/* Tell me about check constraints: 
What are they? What are they good for? 
	a) A check constraint is an SQL query that is used to check the values being
	entered into a record. If the value does not satisfy the condition that the check constraint
	approves of, the record will not be added into the table. Check constraints are good
	for validating user inputs before adding their records into your tbale.
Whatâ€™s the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? 
	a) Because a Check constraint ensures that a condition is met, an advantage would be for example
	using it to check the vlaue of an input. For example, if you did not want records of users above 
	the age of 50 a check contraint can be used with the age column. 

Make up some examples of good uses of check 
constraints and some examples of bad uses of check constraints. Explain the differences in your 
examples and argue your case.

	a)Good Use
		CREATE TABLE users(
			id int,
			f_name text,
			l_name text,
			age int,
			CHECK (age < 50) 
		);

	b)Bad Use
		CREATE TABLE users(
			id int,
			f_name text,
			l_name text,
			age int,
			CHECK (f_name < 50) 
		);

The first example "a" is a good example of how to use check contraints.
In the second example "b" we are using a text column datatype(f_name) for
a Check contraint. This is a bad way to use it.
