/*Whatâ€™s the difference between a LEFT OUTER JOIN and a RIGHT OUTER JOIN? Give example queries in SQL to 
demonstrate. (Feel free to use the CAP2 database t make your points here.)
 	a. The difference between a left and right outer join is which table values get displayed
 if there is not a match found. For example, the left side on the "on" predicate of the join
 will display ALL the results of the left table wheather a match was found or not. Vice versa
 for the right table.*/
